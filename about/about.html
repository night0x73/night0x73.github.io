<div class="abouttext">
My name is Andy Szeto and I am a hobbyist programmer. I graduated from the UW with a BSc. in physics and a minor in math. I have a passion for sports, gaming, digital art, computer science, and most things quantitative.
<br>
<br>
I primarily develop in Java, having experience with Spring Boot as well as the Spring MVC and Hibernate frameworks. 
I also program Python as it is a great general purpose language and some C/C++ because of my enthusiasm for embedded systems and understanding hardware.
