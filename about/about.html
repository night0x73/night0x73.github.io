<div class="abouttext">
My name is Andy Szeto and I am a programmer. I graduated in 2019 with a BSc. in physics and a minor in math. I have a passion for sports, gaming, digital art, computer science, and most things quantitative.
<br>
<br>
I primarily develop in Java, having experience with Spring Boot as well as the Spring MVC and Hibernate frameworks. I also program in Python when the task calls for it; Python was my first programming language, which I have used in number of ways, such as in a physics context. I have always had a strong interest in robotics, lately, I've been educating myself on embedded systems and with it, the C language.
