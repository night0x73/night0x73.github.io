	After spending an immense amount of time learning Java these past two years, I decided to finally pick up Spring, and eventually, Spring Boot. Spring, as I know it, is <i>the</i> framework for Java developers and I believe that understanding how to build projects with this framework will help me level up as a developer; as well as putting myself a step closer towards my career goal. There is a lot to understand about the founding principles of Spring; including dependency injection (loosly coupling objects), inversion of control (client determined flow of control), and the magic of the Spring container.

	SBCs (single board computers) are a new obsession. I've always had an appreciation for small form factor technology and mobility. It’s been difficult to find a RPi4 but I was just gifted an RPi3 (thanks Jeremy). The Odroid c4 was also considered. The Debian-based OS helped me lean into linux, which led me to further my skills in ethical hacking and reinforced my interest in learning about computer systems (particularly systems architecture and networking). 
	<br><br>
	The RPi3 is rocking a 64bit CPU and 1GB of RAM, with WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities. I have plans to use it as a web server to deploy my Java applications and as a linux learning tool. I've spent the last decade using MacOS as my daily driver, so coming from a unix based system made the transition easier. I purchased a plastic case on Amazon that came with a fan and power supply for around $20. After initial configuration, I was able to run it headlessly through my main computer. The RPi3 is not the most seamless experience if you run it as a traditional desktop, but I am eager to get my hands on an RPi4 which offers an even faster processor and iterations with more RAM.
